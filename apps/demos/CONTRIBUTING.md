# Contributing to `@constructor-lab/ui-kit-demos`

This is the **source-only** shared demos workspace — reusable demo
components consumed by both `apps/demo` and `apps/docs`. **Private**,
not published, **no changeset needed**.

See [the root CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the umbrella
process. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for technical context (the
source-only consumption pattern, peer deps, what this workspace is NOT for).

## What goes here

- A demo component that **both** `apps/demo` and `apps/docs` need.
- The official, canonical demo for a published library component
  (i.e. the one referenced from the docs page).

If only one consumer needs the demo, put it in that consumer's `src/`
instead and skip this workspace.

## What does NOT go here

- One-off demos used only by `apps/demo`. Those belong in `apps/demo/src/`.
- Shared utility code. Components only.
- Production logic — these are demonstrations.
- Tests. This workspace has no automated test suite (and no `test` / `test:watch` scripts).

## Workflow

1. Create `src/<component>/<DemoName>.tsx` exporting your demo component.
2. Re-export it from `src/<component>/index.ts` so the `./*` exports map
   picks it up:
   ```ts
   // src/button/index.ts
   export * from './ButtonBasic';
   export * from './ButtonVariants';
   ```
3. **For `apps/docs` consumption**: add a thin client wrapper under
   `apps/docs/src/components/demos/` that adds `'use client'` and
   re-exports your demo. Demo components use hooks and browser APIs;
   they need the directive, but this workspace doesn't add it (it
   exports server-compatible source).
4. **For `apps/docs` consumption**: reference the demo from an MDX
   page in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`:
   ```mdx
   <DemoPreview sourcePath="apps/demos/src/button/ButtonVariants.tsx" ... />
   ```
   See [apps/docs/AGENTS.md](../docs/AGENTS.md) for the `sourcePath`
   convention (relative to monorepo root).
5. **For `apps/demo` consumption**: import directly without a wrapper.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @constructor-lab/ui-kit-demos typecheck
pnpm --filter @constructor-lab/ui-kit-demos lint
```

There is no build step and no test suite in this workspace. Verify your demo renders by running `apps/demo` or `apps/docs` with the demo wired in.

## Dependency version note

This workspace pins **zod 3** (`3.25.76`). `apps/demo` and
`packages/ui-legacy` are on **zod 4**. The form library adapters in
this workspace (`@tanstack/zod-form-adapter`) haven't been upgraded
yet. **Don't bump zod here in passing** — it's a tracked follow-up.
See the catalog comment in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## No changeset needed

This workspace is in `.changeset/config.json`'s `ignore` list.
