General [CI Git Workflow](Link to git docs) need to be followed when you prepare a pull request.
Meanwhile, below a checklist for the items need to do before raised a pull request,
and you can find the details for each point in the remaining part of this document:

13. Submit a Pull Request。

### Pull Request

- Pull request should give details on what has been changed and why.
- Pull request should be small and focused on a single change. A pull request with more than 250 lines of code tend to tkake more than 1 hour to review.
- The title should be self-explanatory, describing what the pull request does.
- The description should provide a clear explanation of the changes made and why they were made.

### Commit types

The following is a list of commit types:

- feat: A new feature or functionality
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Code formatting or component style changes
- refactor: Code changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- perf: Improve performance
- test: Add missing or correct existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies;
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other commits that don’t modify src or test files;
- revert: Revert to a previous commit.

### Testing source code

#### Unit tests

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Vue-test-utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/) are used for the unit testing. 
The spec files must be located at the `src` folder.

#### Visual regression tests

You can find more information about visual regression tests in the [Visual regression tests section](https://acronis.github.io/ui-component-library/guide/testing.html#visual-regression-testing-with-cypress)

#### Performance tests

You can find more information about performance tests in the [Performance tests section](https://acronis.github.io/ui-component-library/guide/testing.html#performance-tests)

### Component documentation

The documentation for each component located at [`docs`](packages/documentation) folder using a Markdown format.
The examples of implementation located at [`demos`](packages/documentation/demos) in Vue.js SFC files format.
For internal documentation we use Vitepress, you can find more information about Vitepress in the [Vitepress documentation](https://vitepress.dev/).

Each document consists of highlights of the API(props, slots, events) with examples and complete details of these components.
If the change in PR including the new API or API updates, you will need to update the API table at the end of the document. 
Meanwhile, it will be convenient for QA to check if an example of the function is provided.

### Component types for TypeScript support

As UI Kit is being used in many TypeScript projects, when there is new API or API updates in the pull request,
we will also need to update the declaration file for UI Kit.
The files located at `types` folder. You can find more information about Typescript declaration file at [Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).

### Bump Version & Update Changelog

We use conventional commit rules in repository. Every commit message must be understandable,
and after all can automatically generate changelog based on every pull request to our repository.
