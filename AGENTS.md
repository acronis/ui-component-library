# AGENTS.md

Single source of truth for AI agents working in `acronis/uikit`.

This file is the **root index**. It is intentionally short (~120 lines) so
it fits in any context window. Specifics live in:

- `./context/*.md` — cross-cutting topics shared across workspaces
- `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` — quirks specific to one workspace

Each workspace also has a sibling `CLAUDE.md` containing only `@AGENTS.md`
so Claude Code's nested auto-load (it walks up from CWD) picks the
workspace's context when you work inside that subtree.

## Repository overview

`acronis/uikit` is a pnpm monorepo containing a React component
library, a demo SPA, a documentation site, a shared demos package, two
design-data packages (assets and tokens), and a build-tooling tier. The
library and the two design-data packages are published; the apps and the
tools are private.

The repo is organized into four top-level directories, each with a
distinct role:

- **`context/`** — Markdown instructions read by both LLMs and humans
  (cross-workspace conventions; each workspace also has its own).
- **`apps/`** — applications that get deployed (e.g. the demo and docs
  sites). Private.
- **`packages/`** — packages published to the npm registry.
- **`tools/`** — scripts that automate, translate, or execute operations
  (e.g. token→CSS builds). Private; never published.

`packages/` holds the published workspaces:

- `packages/ui-legacy/` — the published shadcn-based UI library.
- `packages/ui-react/` houses the published next-generation **Base UI**
  library (`@base-ui/react` as a direct dep), themed by
  `@spec-lab/tokens-pd`. New component work goes here.
- `packages/icons-react/` — published React icon components, **generated**
  from `@spec-lab/design-assets` (24px masters + scale/stroke rules
  baked into a `size` prop). Per-pack subpath exports, tree-shakeable.
- `packages/icons-svg/` — **private, source-only** raw SVG icon sources
  (monocolor + multicolor) fetched from Figma, plus per-page JSON manifests.
  No build; consumed in-repo from `src/`. Synced via its `pull-icons` script
  (which runs `tools/figma-icons-fetcher`) or the `Fetch Figma Icons` workflow.
- `packages/icons-svg-next/` — sibling of `icons-svg` for the **next-gen** icon
  set: same private, source-only model, but pulled from the `shadcn-uikit` Figma
  file with the fetcher's `icon-packs` selection strategy. Synced via its
  `pull-icons` script or the `Fetch Figma Icons (next)` workflow.
- `packages/design-tokens/` and `packages/design-assets/` — the published
  **design-data** packages. These ship JSON (and, for assets, bundled
  binaries) only: no build step, no runtime API. Their one real script
  is `validate` (ajv); `build`/`dev`/`clean`/`lint`/`typecheck` are
  no-ops and `test` aliases `validate`.
- `packages/tokens-pd` ships the consumable token artifacts (per-brand CSS,
  per-component CSS, Tailwind presets, DTCG). It has **no build logic of its own**
  — its `build` delegates to `tools/style-dictionary`, which writes the generated
  (and committed) output into the package.

`tools/` holds private (unpublished) build tooling:

- `tools/style-dictionary/` — a Style Dictionary v5 translation pipeline
  that builds `@spec-lab/design-tokens` into per-brand CSS custom
  properties. Its real script is `build`; output lands in a gitignored
  `dist/`.
- `tools/figma-icons-fetcher/` — fetches SVG icons from a Figma file,
  SVGO-optimizes them, and writes them (with JSON manifests + mono/multicolor
  categorization) into `packages/icons-svg` and `packages/icons-svg-next`. Node
  selection is pluggable (`frames-by-name` / `new-frames` / `icon-packs`). Run via `tsx` (no
  build step); drives the `Fetch Figma Icons` workflows and each package's
  `pull-icons` script.
- `tools/figma-token-exporter/` — a **self-hosted Figma plugin + local
  receiver** that exports design-token variables/styles into
  `packages/design-tokens/.tmp/figma-tokens/` (the snapshot the sync emitters
  consume). It replaces the third-party figma-console Desktop Bridge for the
  bulk token pull; its `src/convert.ts` faithfully ports figma-console's
  variable→DTCG serialization so the snapshot stays a drop-in. Run the receiver
  via `tsx`; the plugin is imported into Figma Desktop from its `manifest.json`.
  Used by the `/sync-tokens` flow.

## Scripts vocabulary

Every workspace exposes the same script names. Run any of them as:

- `pnpm -r <name>` — all workspaces, topological order
- `pnpm --filter <package> <name>` — single workspace

Names: `dev` · `build` · `test` · `test:watch` · `lint` · `lint:fix` · `typecheck` · `clean`

Root-only scripts (from the repo root):

- `format`, `format:check` — Prettier across the tree
- `changeset`, `version`, `release` — Changesets CLI passthroughs
- `husky` — runs lint-staged + typecheck (used by the pre-commit hook)

`apps/demos` is intentionally source-only: its `dev`/`build` scripts are
no-ops because the package is consumed via source-file exports. Tools
follow the same vocabulary too: `tools/style-dictionary`'s real work is
`build` (with `test`/`test:watch` running vitest); only `dev` is a no-op.

## How agents should navigate this repo

1. **Always read this file first** — it tells you which workspace owns
   your task.
2. **Read the workspace's `AGENTS.md`** for the area you're editing.
   The workspace owns its own conventions, testing, theming, etc. in a
   workspace-local `context/` directory.
3. **Pull from this repo's root `./context/<topic>.md`** when relevant
   — it holds only the truly cross-workspace topics.

Cross-workspace context is intentionally minimal. Anything specific to
how a particular workspace is built, tested, or styled lives **inside
that workspace**, never here.

## Always-loaded cross-cutting context

@context/conventions.md
@context/commits.md

## Cross-cutting context (read on demand)

- `context/releasing.md` — Changesets workflow that applies to any
  published workspace in the monorepo.
- `context/roadmap.md` — product roadmap (epics, phases, v1 scope/timeline);
  tracked on GitHub Project #3 as issues #102–108. Companion task breakdowns:
  `context/backlog-p2-primitives.md`, `context/backlog-p3-p4.md`.
- `context/e1-theme-delivery.md` — E1 (#102) theme-delivery implementation
  proposal: how the open theme sub-issues (#172/#173/#175/#101/#177) get built on
  the shipped `tokens-pd` pipeline, and what's reused from the legacy stack.
- `context/project-board.md` — how we run Project #3: epic/task model, status
  lifecycle + gates, fields, views, and automation.
- `context/next-gen-components-migration.md` — migrating the component token tier
  to Figma's next-gen `brand.components` (Option A naming, emitter rework,
  tokens-pd impact, ui-react per-component re-theme). §9 tracks execution status,
  the remaining ui-react backlog, and the Radio/Search/Select token gap.
- `packages/ui-spec/context/component-specs-proposal.md` — **Proposed**
  (not yet adopted):
  framework-agnostic component specs + a machine-readable design grammar, to
  support future non-React implementations and agent tooling.
- `context/kit-consistency-audit-proposal.md` — **Proposed** (not yet adopted):
  cross-component consistency rules (grammar), a common-inconsistency checklist,
  a complete-screen consistency audit (render real screens → structural + AI
  detectors), reference-implementation diffing, and a self-improving feedback
  loop + new AI skills. Extends the component-specs proposal above.

## Tooling preconditions

- **Package manager**: pnpm `10.27.0` (declared in root `packageManager`).
  Enable via `corepack enable` or `npm install -g pnpm@10.27.0`.
- **Node**: 22.x (CI uses Node 22).
- **TypeScript** for all new source code.
- The catalog block in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the single source of
  truth for shared dependency versions — bump there, not per workspace.
  Respect intentional drift noted in catalog comments.
- Use `pnpm --filter <package> <script>` over `cd <workspace> && pnpm <script>`.
- **Never** use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks; fix the underlying
  issue. The pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` + `typecheck`.

## What this repo does NOT have

To prevent agents inventing things from outdated knowledge:

- **No Vue**. The repo is React-only. Any `.vue` reference is stale.
- **No VitePress**. Docs are Next.js + Fumadocs at `apps/docs/`.
- **No `packages/documentation/` or `packages/examples/`**. Those paths
  never existed in this repo.
