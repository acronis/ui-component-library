# @constructor-lab/figma-icons-fetcher

Private build tool. Fetches SVG icons from a Figma file, optimizes them with
SVGO, and writes them — with optional JSON manifests and mono/multicolor
categorization — into a target package.

It is the engine behind `packages/icons-svg`'s `pull-icons` script and the
`Fetch Figma Icons` GitHub Action. Not published to npm.

## Usage

The tool reads its configuration from `FIGMA_FETCHER_*` environment variables
(via `.env`, `.env.local`, then `process.env`). See
[`.env.local.example`](./.env.local.example) for the full list.

### As a workspace dependency (the normal path)

`packages/icons-svg` runs the tool from its own directory so that relative
output paths (`./src/svg`, …) and `.env.local` resolve there:

```bash
pnpm --filter @constructor-lab/icons-svg pull-icons
```

### Standalone

```bash
# from this workspace, with a local .env.local
pnpm --filter @constructor-lab/figma-icons-fetcher fetch-icons
```

### Programmatically

```ts
import { fetchIcons } from '@constructor-lab/figma-icons-fetcher';

await fetchIcons({
  token: '…',
  fileKey: '…',
  pageNames: ['Icons'],
  frameNames: ['16px', '24px'],
  outputDir: './icons',
});
```

## Source: pages vs. a node

Icons come from one of two sources:

- **Named pages** (default) — set `FIGMA_FETCHER_PAGE_NAMES`. The fetcher does a
  two-call lookup (file structure → page nodes) and runs the strategy on each
  page.
- **A single node** — set `FIGMA_FETCHER_NODE_ID` to a node id (e.g. a section
  or frame). The fetcher pulls that node's subtree directly and runs the
  strategy on it; `PAGE_NAMES` is then ignored. The id uses a colon
  (`2246:3201`); the hyphenated URL form (`node-id=2246-3201`) is accepted too.

## Selection strategies

`FIGMA_FETCHER_SELECTION_STRATEGY` decides _which_ nodes inside the target
source become icons. The fetch step (named pages or a single node) is
independent of the strategy; only the node-selection step differs. Strategies
live in `src/strategies/`.

- **`frames-by-name`** (default) — within each page, take the frames whose name
  is in `FIGMA_FETCHER_FRAME_NAMES` (e.g. `16px,24px,32px`) and collect every
  `COMPONENT` node nested under them. Components named `_*` are skipped. The
  page name is used for manifest grouping. This is what `packages/icons-svg`
  uses.

- **`new-frames`** — the page's top-level frames are treated as **categories**
  (used for manifest grouping). Within each category, every frame badged with a
  `New` text label (the green redesign frames) is found, and the icon leaves
  inside it are collected — i.e. `FRAME`/`INSTANCE`/`COMPONENT` nodes, skipping
  grids (`_*`), placeholders (`?`), and auto-named layout wrappers (`Frame 12`).
  `FIGMA_FETCHER_FRAME_NAMES` is ignored.

- **`icon-packs`** — for the `icon-packs-source` section (fetched via
  `FIGMA_FETCHER_NODE_ID`). Each top-level frame of the section is one **pack**
  (`stroke-mono`, `stroke-multi`, `solid-mono`, `solid-multi`). Icons are the
  `COMPONENT` leaves named `_assetsource/<Name>` (the prefix is stripped).
  Manifest grouping follows the pack's layout: icons nested in a `Category`
  frame are grouped `<pack>/<category>` (the category name is read from its
  `CategoryTitle` text), so e.g. `stroke-mono` splits into `stroke-mono-arrows`,
  `stroke-mono-shapes`, … ; icons listed directly under a pack are grouped under
  the pack itself. This is what `packages/icons-svg` uses.

## Sync behavior

- `outputDir` (and any `outputDirs`) are **fully replaced** with the current
  set of icons from Figma — a clean sync.
- `monocolor-icons/` and `multicolor-icons/` are **never cleaned**; only icons
  that are new since the last sync are added. This preserves legacy icons that
  were removed from Figma but are still referenced in consuming code.
- The manifest dir is only wiped first when `FIGMA_FETCHER_CLEAN_MANIFESTS` is
  set — otherwise manifests are written over in place, so a renamed/removed
  group leaves a stale file behind. Enable cleaning when the dir holds only
  generated manifests; leave it off when it also holds hand-maintained ones.

## Scripts

| Script        | What it does                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `fetch-icons` | Runs the fetch (`tsx src/index.ts`) |
| `test`        | Unit specs (`vitest run`)           |
| `lint`        | ESLint                              |
| `typecheck`   | `tsc --noEmit`                      |

`build`/`dev`/`clean` are no-ops — this is a runtime tool, not a compiled
artifact.
