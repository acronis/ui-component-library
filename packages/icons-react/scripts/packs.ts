/**
 * Single source of truth for the icon packs this library generates from
 * `@spec-lab/icons-svg-next`, shared by the generator and the Vite lib
 * config.
 *
 * - `name` — published subpath (the `icons-` prefix is dropped) and `src/packs`
 *   directory.
 * - `paint` — `stroke` packs apply the rule-derived stroke width and default
 *   `fill: none`; `solid` packs paint via `fill`.
 * - `multicolor` — `false` (mono) collapses authored colors to `currentColor`
 *   so the icon inherits text color; `true` keeps the authored colors (and
 *   namespaces any gradient/clip ids to avoid cross-icon collisions).
 *
 * Pack → manifest mapping: a pack reads every icons-svg-next manifest named
 * `<name>` or `<name>-<category>` (so `stroke-mono` merges its six category
 * manifests), and resolves each icon name to the flat `svg/<name>.svg`.
