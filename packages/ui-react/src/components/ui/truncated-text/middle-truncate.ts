// The pure search behind `<TruncateText mode="middle">`: given a string, a pixel budget, and a
// way to measure a candidate's rendered width, find the longest start+end slice
// (joined by an ellipsis) that still fits — preserving both ends of the string
// rather than just the start, which is what a plain CSS end-ellipsis already does
// and is useless for a URL, hash or path whose distinguishing part is at the tail.
//
// Binary search over "how many non-ellipsis characters to keep", not over the split
// point between start/end — the split is always the same proportion (kept chars
// divided evenly, the extra one going to the start on an odd count), so there is
// exactly one candidate per kept-count and `measure` is called O(log n) times
// rather than O(n). `measure` is injected rather than hard-coded to
// `canvas.measureText` specifically so this file has no DOM dependency: the real
// component supplies a canvas-backed measurer (see `truncate-text.tsx`), and
// these tests supply a deterministic fake — happy-dom has no layout engine, so a test
// asserting real pixel widths would need the browser project for no benefit here,
// the search logic does not care what "width" means.
