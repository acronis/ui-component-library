// The curated story subset run by the `system-dark` and `forced-light` capture
// profiles (see `.storybook/visual-regression.ts` for what those profiles assert).
//
// ── WHY A SUBSET, AND WHY IT IS SOUND ────────────────────────────────────────
// Those two profiles do not commit baselines. They re-render an existing baseline
// from a DIFFERENT theme input and assert the pixels are unchanged — a property
// that holds per story, independently. So a sample tests the same claim the full
// corpus would; it just tests it on fewer stories. That is unlike the light/dark
// profiles, which OWN their 765 baselines each and must therefore be exhaustive.
//
// ── WHY TITLES, NOT STORY IDS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `@storybook/test-runner` in index-json mode writes ONE generated test file per
// story *title* — `getIndexTempDir` in `dist/test-storybook.js` does
// `tmpDir/${titleId}.test.js`, with every story in that title a `test()` inside
// it. jest's test-path filter therefore selects titles; there is no path-level
// handle on an individual story. (`--includeTags` is the per-story lever, but it
// needs a `tags:` entry added to each chosen story — 124 story-file edits to
// express what 21 titles already express.)
//
// ── HOW THE TITLES WERE CHOSEN ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Not "the popular components". One title per DISTINCT MECHANISM that can render
// differently when the theme arrives via the OS rather than via `[data-theme]`:
// each group below is a different way the two inputs can disagree. Adding another
// button-like component would add stories but no new mechanism.

/**
 * @typedef {{ id: string, title: string, type: string }} IndexEntry
 */

/**
 * Storybook titles in the subset, grouped by the mechanism each group probes.
 * Keep the grouping — it is the argument for why the sample is representative,
 * and it is what tells a future reader whether their new component needs adding.

 *
 * ── WHY NOT ONE `(a|b|c)` ALTERNATION: IT WAS MEASURED, AND IT DIES ──────────
 * The obvious single-regex form got as far as the container and then:
 *
 *     /bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
 *
 * printed AFTER `test-storybook` had already started (it had logged its
 * index-json and Vite notices), so the shell that choked was not the compose
 * `sh -c`. That one is fine: `$VISUAL_TEST_ARGS` unquoted undergoes field
 * splitting and pathname expansion but is NOT rescanned for metacharacters, and
 * `docker run … sh -c 'printf "%s\n" $VISUAL_TEST_ARGS'` passes `(`, `|` and `\`
 * through intact. The breakage is a SECOND shell downstream, inside the runner's
 * own re-invocation, which parses the already-expanded string as source.
 *
 * The lesson is not "escape it better" — it is that the number of shell passes
 * between here and jest's argv is not knowable from here, and any single-pass
 * escaping is a guess about a layer we do not control. So the patterns are built
 * from an ALLOWLIST of characters that are inert to a shell no matter how many
 * times they are parsed: letters, digits, `/`, `.`, `_`, `-`. No parens, no
 * pipes, no backslashes, no `$` anchor.
 *
 * Two consequences of that allowlist, both deliberate:
 *   - **`.` stays a regex wildcard** rather than the escaped `\.` we would
 *     prefer. It over-matches only a path spelled like `/ui-chartXtest.js`, and
 *     the directory being matched contains nothing but `<titleId>.test.js` files
 *     that Storybook itself just wrote.
 *   - **No trailing `$`.** The leading `/` still prevents `ui-chart` matching
 *     `xui-chart.test.js`, which is the collision that actually threatens us.
