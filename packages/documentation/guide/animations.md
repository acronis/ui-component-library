# Animations and transitions

Animations are a great way to add visual feedback to your app. 
They can be used to make your app easier to use, to draw the user's attention to a specific part of the screen, or to make your app more fun and engaging.

We provide some simple aimations based on CSS transitions and keyframe animations.
With some usage of hardware accelerated transforms and opacity changes, we can create smooth animations that perform well even on mobile devices.
