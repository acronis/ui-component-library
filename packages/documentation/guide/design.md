# Figma Best Practices

## Figma naming conventions for content designers

Clear intentionality in naming conventions is key to a successful design system.
Here are some conventions that we recommend:

- use `Title Case` for all names
- use `Component / Variant / Property` structure for all components sets
- Always rename the default name of a component and variant to something meaningful
- turn each layer into component
- turn components into component sets
- toggle variants to with component properties
