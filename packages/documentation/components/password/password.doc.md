The password entry field can be used in several versions: Basic Input with a value input (by default, the characters are replaced with dots).
Input with the ability to show / hide the entered characters (the action occurs after the icon is clicked).
Input with password strength scale (the scale works depending on the required conditions and shows the status of the password, depending on the number of characters or complexity of the entered password).
