## Placement

Use the `placement` attribute to set the position of the dropdown. The value is a string with two parts: `orientation` and `alignment`. The orientation can be `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom`. The alignment can be `start`, `end`, or `null`. The default alignment is `null`. For example, `placement="left-end"` will display the dropdown to the left of the trigger element, with the bottom of the dropdown aligned with the bottom of the trigger element.
