## Accessibility

Separators must be ignored by the screenreader.
To achieve this, use `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.

It must provide `role=separator` that indicates the element is a divider that
separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of elements.

Optionally, you can provide `aria-orientation` attribute to describe the separator direction.
