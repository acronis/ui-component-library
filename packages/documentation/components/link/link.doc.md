Links are used to embedding actions or pathways to more information in a sentence or used in tables with the possibility to drill down to the deeper level.

In other cases preferable to use ghost buttons.

## Accessibility

Provided `AcvLink` component must adapt to the list of
[WAI-ARIA link accessibility patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/link/).

### Descriptive Link text

    - write link text so that it describes the content of the link target;
    - avoid using generic text like "click here" or "more" as it is not descriptive;
    - use unique link text for each link on the page;

## Keyboard Interaction

    - `Enter` or `Space` key activates the link;

## Roles and properties

Link text should provide enough information about the target of the link.
