Used when the action takes a certain amount of time.

Loading can be global and override the entire interface or local, for example, show the status of an operation in a separate section or button.

Loading informs the user about the current status of the operation, but does not report when the process ends and is applied when the completion time of the operation is not known in advance.

In all other cases, circle progress is used.
