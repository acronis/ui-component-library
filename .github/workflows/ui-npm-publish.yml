# This workflow will run tests using node and then publish a package to GitHub Packages when a release is created
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages
#  _Using the default `github.token` (or `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`),
#  [will not trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)
#  another workflow, which depends on the [`release`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release) event. i.e._
#
#  ```yaml
#     on:
#       release:
#         types:
#           - published
#           ...
#  ```
#  If you want to make use of another workflow
#  which depends on the release event that may be triggered by using this action,
#  you will have to supply a personal access token secret for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
#  For more information on creating a Personal Access Token,
#  see the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)._
