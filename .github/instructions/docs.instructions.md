## Documentation requirements (Acronis UI Component Library)

These instructions reflect how documentation is authored and generated in this repository using VitePress and vue-docgen. Follow them for all new and updated docs.

### Where docs live
- VitePress site: `packages/documentation/`
- Home and guides: `packages/documentation/index.md`, `packages/documentation/guide/`
- Component docs: `packages/documentation/components/<component>/<component>.md`
- Component narrative/examples: `packages/documentation/components/<component>/<component>.doc.md`
- Live demo sources: `packages/examples/demos/<component>/`
- Theming/tokens: `packages/documentation/theming/`

### Generated vs. authored files
- Files ending in `<component>.md` under `packages/documentation/components/**` are generated by `vue-docgen`.
  - They include the line: “This file is generated automatically… Changes made here will be lost.”
  - Do not edit these files directly.
- Author content in the paired `<component>.doc.md` file. This is included from the generated `.md` via:
  ```md
  <!--@include: ./<component>.doc.md-->
  ```
- To regenerate component docs, run in `packages/documentation/`:
  ```bash
  pnpm run generate:docs
  ```

### Local development and build
- Dev server:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter ./packages/documentation run dev
  ```
  Visit http://localhost:5173/ui-component-library/
- Build and preview:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter ./packages/documentation run build
  pnpm --filter ./packages/documentation run preview
  ```

### Frontmatter and metadata
- Use VitePress frontmatter at the top of authored pages when needed:
  ```md
  ---
  title: ACV Button component
  lang: en-US
  editLink: true
  description: Short description shown in search and meta
  ---
  ```
- For the home page and special layouts, follow the patterns in `packages/documentation/index.md`.

### Writing component docs (`*.doc.md`)
- Start with a short overview of the component and when to use it.
- Structure content with H2 sections (##): Overview, Basic usage, Variants, States, Sizing, Accessibility, See also.
- Embed interactive demos by importing example `.vue` files from `packages/examples/demos/...` using the fenced include pattern:
  ```md
  <ButtonBasic />

  ::: details Source code
  <<< ../../../examples/demos/button/ButtonBasic.vue
  :::
  ```
- Use additional demo components (e.g., `<ButtonDocTypes />`) where they exist in `packages/examples/`.
- Link to related components and theming pages using site-relative links, e.g. `/components/button-group/buttonGroup.doc` or `/theming/colors`.
- Provide an Accessibility section with references to relevant WAI-ARIA patterns when meaningful (see `components/button/button.doc.md`).

### Authoring guides and theming
- Place conceptual guides in `packages/documentation/guide/` and theming content in `packages/documentation/theming/`.
- Keep guides concise, with code examples and links back to components.

### Style and formatting
- Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) with sentence case.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet lists for readability.
- Use fenced code blocks with language hint (e.g., `ts`, `vue`, `bash`).
- Keep component and prop names in backticks, e.g., `AcvButton`, `variant`.
- Use site-relative links for internal pages; full URLs only for external resources.

### Linting and quality checks
- Lint styles and code referenced in docs using the documentation package scripts:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter ./packages/documentation run lint
  pnpm --filter ./packages/documentation run lint:fix
  ```
- Stylelint is configured for `**/*.{css,vue}`; ESLint and `vue-tsc` validate authored code snippets where applicable.

### Do and don’t
- Do author content in `*.doc.md`; do not edit generated `*.md` under `components/**`.
- Do reference demos from `packages/examples/demos/**` to keep code examples compilable and reusable.
- Do keep examples minimal, focused, and aligned with current component APIs and class names.
- Don’t paste large inline snapshots or overly long code blocks—link or include the demo file instead.

### Quick template for a new component doc (`<component>.doc.md`)
```md
## Overview
Short, action-oriented description.

## Basic usage
<<ComponentBasicDemo />

::: details Source code
<<< ../../../examples/demos/<component>/<ComponentBasicDemo>.vue
:::

## Variants
<ComponentVariantsDemo />

::: details Source code
<<< ../../../examples/demos/<component>/<ComponentVariantsDemo>.vue
:::

## Accessibility
Briefly list relevant ARIA roles, keyboard interactions, and links to WAI‑ARIA patterns.

## See also
- [Related component](/components/related/related.doc)
- [Theming](/theming/colors)
```

### When to regenerate docs
- After changing component props, slots, or events, re-run `pnpm run generate:docs` inside `packages/documentation/` so generated tables stay in sync.
- Commit both the authored `.doc.md` and the regenerated `.md` outputs.
